# AgentExperience.Storage.Postgres

Stores AgentExperience.NET Experience Records in PostgreSQL through the `IExperienceRecordStore` port, using plain
Npgsql.

Pinned to `Npgsql` **10.0.3** (exact). Integration tests run against PostgreSQL 16 (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`) through
`Testcontainers.PostgreSql` 4.15.0. This package does not use EF Core, Dapper, Pgvector, or the pgvector extension.

## Usage

```csharp
using AgentExperience.Abstractions;
using AgentExperience.Storage.Postgres;
using Npgsql;

await using var dataSource = NpgsqlDataSource.Create(connectionString);
IExperienceRecordStore store = new PostgresExperienceRecordStore(dataSource);

// Established by the host from its own authentication and authorization. Never built from request input.
var authorization = new AuthorizationContext(
    TenantId: "tenant-1",
    PrincipalId: "svc-support-agent",
    Roles: ["experience:write"],
    IssuedAt: DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
    ProjectId: "support");          // optional bound: this caller may only touch the "support" project

var created = await store.CreateAsync(authorization, record, cancellationToken);
var read = await store.GetAsync(authorization, record.Scope, record.ExperienceId, cancellationToken);
var page = await store.QueryAsync(
    authorization,
    new ExperienceRecordQuery(record.Scope, Statuses: [ExperienceStatus.Validated], Limit: 20),
    cancellationToken);
```

The store never disposes the data source. The host owns it.

## Trusted host boundary

- `AuthorizationContext` is the authority, and `Scope` only selects within it. The host must build the context from
  its own trusted identity and permission checks, never from model output or request payloads.
- `TenantId` must always match. A non-null bound (`ApplicationId`, `ProjectId`, `TeamId`, `AgentId`, `UserId`) must
  equal the request scope's field exactly. A null bound leaves that field unrestricted. A scope outside the context
  returns `Denied` before any connection opens.
- Scope matching in SQL is exact, ordinal, and case-sensitive. A null optional scope field matches only null
  (`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`) and never acts as a wildcard. Empty or whitespace scope values are `Invalid`.
- A get for an ID that exists in another scope returns `NotFound`, the same as a missing ID. A create with an
  existing ID returns `Conflict` without record data, whichever scope owns the existing record.
- This store does not evaluate roles. Role-based decisions stay with the host.

## Results and failures

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Saved | `Created` |
| Read (a query with no matches is still `Found`) | `Found` |
| ID missing, or in another scope | `NotFound` |
| Scope outside the authorization context | `Denied` (no connection opened) |
| Malformed request | `Invalid` with every `StoreValidationError(Path, Message)` (no connection opened) |
| ID already exists in any scope | `Conflict` (stored row unchanged) |
| Database or driver failure (`NpgsqlException`, `SocketException`, `TimeoutException`) | throws `ExperienceStoreException` with the original as `InnerException` |
| Stored row with an unsupported `payload_version` or an unreadable payload | throws `ExperienceStoreException` |
| Caller cancellation | throws `OperationCanceledException`, unwrapped |

Validation messages never contain record payload content, and the store does not log.

A create whose acknowledgement was lost (cancelled or timed out after PostgreSQL committed it) returns `Conflict`
when retried. After a `Conflict`, call `GetAsync` in your own scope to check whether the stored record is yours.

## Schema

The schema lives in the embedded script `Migrations/0001_create_experience_records.sql`. It creates the
`agent_experience` schema and the `experience_records` table:

- Scope, task, status, confidence, counter, revision, and timestamp columns, with `CHECK` constraints for non-blank
  scope and value ranges.
- A JSONB `payload` column for attempts, outcome, evidence, reflection, environment, and provenance.
- A `payload_version` column. This adapter owns versioning, so the domain types carry no version field.
- An index on `(tenant_id, application_id, project_id)`.

No migration runner ships yet. Until one does, apply the scripts yourself, in order, before using the store:

```csharp
foreach (var name in PostgresExperienceRecordSchema.ScriptNames)
{
    await using var command = dataSource.CreateCommand(PostgresExperienceRecordSchema.GetScript(name));
    await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(cancellationToken);
}
```

The script is plain SQL with no journal table and uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, so a DbUp-style migrator can later run it
unchanged. Applying it needs permission to create schemas and tables. The store itself only needs `INSERT` and
`SELECT` on `agent_experience.experience_records`.

## Data semantics

- **Create-only.** Each create is a single `INSERT`. Updates, deletes, and lifecycle events belong to later stories.
- **UTC timestamps.** Every timestamp is stored and returned in UTC. `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` are columns, and
  PostgreSQL keeps microsecond precision, so sub-microsecond ticks are truncated on write. Nested timestamps are
  stored in the payload at full precision.
- **Tool-call arguments** are stored as JSON and read back normalized to `string`, `bool`, `long` (integers that
  fit), `double`, `null`, `Dictionary<string, object?>`, or `List<object?>`. Dictionary key order is not preserved.
  Whole-number doubles (for example `1.0`) are written as JSON integers, so they read back as `long`. Values that cannot be serialized to JSON (for
  example `NaN`, infinities, or cyclic graphs) make the create `Invalid`.
- **Query order** is newest `CreatedAt` first, then `ExperienceId` in PostgreSQL `uuid` byte order, which differs
  from .NET `Guid` comparison. `Limit` must be from 1 to 500 (default 50).
  `Statuses` is either null (all statuses) or a non-empty list.
- PostgreSQL cannot store the NUL character (U+0000) in `text` or `jsonb`, so a record or scope containing it is
  `Invalid` and never reaches the database.
